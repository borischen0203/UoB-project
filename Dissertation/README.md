# **Detection App of Laptop Battery Rating Label drawing**

```
  The engineers wasted too much time to check Label contents by human review. 
Moreover, human review is not perfect. It could not guarantee 100% accurate. 
Even if the Label has a wrong alphabet, it may cause cost lost for the company.
Therefore, using a tool to help detection is importantâ€”this project aimed to develop 
an application to detect the label drawing. With saving time, engineers can spend 
more time on product development.
