**Detection App of Laptop Battery Rating Label drawing**

It could not guarantee 100% accurate. Even if the Label has a wrong alphabet, it may cause cost lost for the company.
Therefore, using a tool to help detection is importantâ€”this project aimed to develop an application to detect the 
label drawing. With saving time, engineers can spend more time on product development.
